When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work 
local?

A: If I want to make my local repository open to the public or to any of my 
collaborators. This way, the repository can be updated by people working on other
tools and features, while I am working on my own features. 


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up to date with your remote repository?

A: As with merging, there may be conflicts that could be introduced by pulling from a remote repository (other people may  have editied)
