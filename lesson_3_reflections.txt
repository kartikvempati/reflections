When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work 
local?

A: If I want to make my local repository open to the public or to any of my 
collaborators. This way, the repository can be updated by people working on other
tools and features, while I am working on my own features. 


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up to date with your remote repository?

A: As with merging, there may be conflicts that could be introduced by pulling
from a remote repository (other people may  have editied)

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use 
one instead of another?

A: A fork is a tool that copies someone elses Github repository to your 
repository, so you can make your changes without affecting the actual repository.
A clone is a local copy of a github repository that can be edited and pushed back.
A branch is a local tool that allows for multiple commits with the same parent 
commit, thus allowing new features and tools to be implemented without changing 
the master branch functionality. Fork is used to take someone elses Github 
repository and add to your own Github repository. Clone is used to work locally on 
a Github repository, and branch is used for experimental features that can be 
merged if successful with the stable branch which is developed alongside.
